This is a project try to create a simple web page using chatgpt.

Here are the questions to I ask
- any free finance api in the market
- please give me example to use alphavantage.co api using python
- how to display in webpage in python then
- show me the index.html
- from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries show errors. am i missing something
- import requests has error
- I still got Import "alpha_vantage.timeseries" could not be resolved Pylance
- the pandas library was not found
- it seems that timeseries is premium api, any free api
- please show me example to how to create webpage use intraday timeserives  data
- what is the example of index.html

as I want to hide the api key, I ask
- how to hide the api key in .env

1) from https://www.alphavantage.co/ obtain the api key
2) Run in terminal--> pip install alpha_vantage
                    ---> pip install request
                    ---> pip install pandas
                    ---> pip install python-dotenv
                    ---> pip install mplcursors --user

3) run > python timeseries_intraday.py
4) access the webpage that running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

My thoughts:
1) Questions need to be detail, for example, in my second question, I miss the word "free api". Chatgpt showed 
   me timeseries from alphavantage which is for premium members.
2) The programs are simple but working. Chatgpt assumes you already install the libraries required.
